In a simulation study we're often interested in exploring the behavior of a sample 
statistic (ie the total number of coins that are heads). The following provides 
a general guideline for building simulation studies in R.

1. Create a function that performs a single simulation and returns the value of 
importance.
    - This value may be the total count of something, a proportion, or any other 
    summary statistic calculated based on a **single sample**.
2. Using the function previously created, run thousands of simulations and capture 
the results.
    - After this step, you will have thousands of values, each representing the 
    result of a single simulation.
3. Given the collection of values resulting from step 2, calculate the value you
set out to determine.
    - This caculation takes the thousands of values previously calculated and
    condenses them into a single summary value (ie mean, proportion, etc).
4. Calculate Monte Carlo (simulation) error.
    - Calculate a confidence interval around the summary statistic calculated in
    step 3. This confidence interval is a function of the summary statistic itself 
    as well as the number of simulations performed (the size of your sample).
    
Note:
It can be useful to wrap all the above steps into a single function so that 
multiple simulations can be easily performed.
