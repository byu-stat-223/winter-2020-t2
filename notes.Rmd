*My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the 
wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. He hath 
filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded 
mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.*

*Considering the Savior’s great promise for peace in this life and eternal life 
in the life to come, discipleship is a price worth paying. It is a price we cannot 
afford not to pay. By measure, the requirements of discipleship are much, much 
less than the promised blessings.*

*The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do.
Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our
thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times
we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you, which is why the
scriptures are replete with the Lord’s counsel: “Be of good cheer, and do not
fear.”*

*Because the Restoration reaffirmed the foundational truth that God does work in
this world, we can hope, we should hope, even when facing the most
insurmountable odds. That is what the scripture meant when Abraham was able to
hope against hope — that is, he was able to believe in spite of every reason not
to believe — that he and Sarah could conceive a child when that seemed utterly
impossible.*

*No matter what kind of storm is battering us — regardless of whether there is a
solution to it or whether there’s an end in sight — there is only one refuge,
and it is the same for all types of storms. This single refuge provided by our
Heavenly Father is our Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement.*

*Chidi, here's the thing with stuff. You can look at a problem from every angle
and drive yourself crazy, but sometimes, you just gotta huck a Molotov cocktail
at a drone and see what happens... I mean, where I'm from, most things blow up
eventually. So I learned that when something dope comes along, you gotta lock it
down. If you're always frozen in fear and taking too long to think about what to
do, you'll miss your opportunity and maybe get sucked into the propeller of a
swamp boat.*

*...Alma noted, “Time only is measured unto men.” Because speed is a measure of
distance over time, if time becomes less relevant, so does speed. Thus, in
eternal things, such as our ongoing progress in becoming like God, direction is
more important than speed. In the long run, the direction we are headed matters
much more than the rate at which we are moving.*

*... where does God’s light not seek to shine? What field of inquiry can stand
apart from questions of ultimate reality? Of divine love? Of God’s design in
creation and redemption? To paraphrase a modern revelation, which powerfully
echoes ancient ones, God’s light proceeds from His presence to fill the
immensity of space and is thereby in all things. Would we dare circumscribe that
light? An eminent scholar and Christian believer wrote this of faith and
scholarship: “Put most simply, for believers to be studying created things is to
be studying the works of Christ.” This insight hardly limits learning. It should
set it free.*

*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very
