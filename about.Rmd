I'm a family man at heart. I have a beautiful wife and three wonderful kids
(Ellie, Charlie, and Fox) with our second boy expected in July. I enjoy spending
every moment I can with my family. Together we enjoy camping, kayaking,
gardening, watching movies, and eating pizza. When I'm not with my family or
working, I can usually be found playing piano, cycling, playing basketball, or
playing racquetball. While my undergraduate degree is in Statistics and my
graduate degree is in Data Science, I consider myself more of a software
professional than anything else. I'm an avid R advocate, user, and developer. I
work for [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} as a Solutions
Engineer where I help enterprises integrate RStudio products into their data
environments. I also work on R packages, write for the [RViews
blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}, and work to create
resources that will benefit the R community.
