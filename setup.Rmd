This document will guide you through the setup of [git](https://git-scm.com/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/), which we will use for all assignments and
exams. For an indepth look at git and GitHub for the R user, consider this 
[article](talk-about-version-control.pdf).

## git
[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system. In other words, git 
provides a mechanism for keeping track of different versions of files. This 
allows users to be intentional about changes made, and allows for quick 
experimentation of new ideas without fear of irreparably breaking things. It is
also a powerful tool for collaboration.

### Install {.tabset}
#### MacOS
1. Pick the option you are most comfortable with [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#macos)
    - If you don't know, choose option 1. The shell can be accessed by using the 
    Terminal application on your Mac
2. Open the Terminal
3. Enter the following to ensure git was correctly installed:  
  `which git; git --version`
4. Introduce yourself to git with the following commands:  
  `git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'`  
  `git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'`  
  Your user name can be whatever you want (I recommend first and last name).
  Make sure you use a valid email address - you will need to use this same email
  in a moment to signup for a GitHub account.
5. Confirm that the previous commands worked by entering the following:  
  `git config --global --list`
  
#### Windows
1. Follow Option 1 [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
2. Open GitBash ![](git-bash.png)
3. Enter the following to ensure git was correctly installed:  
  `which git; git --version`
4. Introduce yourself to git with the following commands:  
  `git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'`  
  `git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'`  
  Your user name can be whatever you want (I recommend first and last name).
  Make sure you use a valid email address - you will need to use this same email
  in a moment to signup for a GitHub account.
5. Confirm that the previous commands worked by entering the following:  
  `git config --global --list`

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides a place to host git repositories. This
makes it easy to collaborate and work together on code projects. In this course,
GitHub is where you will submit your homework assignments. James and the TAs
will review your homework and provide feedback through GitHub.

1. Create an account at GitHub.com
    - Please use the same email address that you used to setup in git
    - Choose a professional and brief username - this is an account you could 
    end up using for years to come.
    
Once you have your GitHub account setup, you will be able to access and host 
remote repositories. In order to enable you to commit and push assignments 
without needing to enter your username and password each time, we are going to 
use SSH keys. These will be setup in the next step.
  
## RStudio
1. Open RStudio (if you already have it open, close it completely and re-open)
    - I recommend installing the Preview version of RStudio available
    [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
2. Go to Tools -> Global Options
3. Select Git/SVN on the lefthand side  
4. Check for something in the Git executable (doesn't need to be identical to 
this)  
![](git-executable.png)
5. Check for something in SSH RSA key  
![](ssh-rsa-key.png)
    - It's likely that you don't have anything here - that's ok.
    - Click on Create RSA Key...
    - Don't use a password
    - Click View public key
    - Copy to Clipboard
6. Go to your GitHub account in a web browser
7. Click on the icon in the top right corner and select Settings  
![](gh-settings.png)
8. Click on SSH and GPG keys on the lefthand side
    - Click on ![](gh-new-ssh.png)
    - Give it a meaningful title (Something like "My Laptop" or "Stat 223")
    - Paste in the key you copied from RStudio
9. Follow OS specific instructions 
[here](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#add-key-to-ssh-agent)

## Confirm setup
Confirm things are working by creating a new RStudio project for [HW1](hw1.html)

1. Follow the link at the top of [HW1](hw1.html) to create your GitHub 
repository for HW1
2. Click on link to view your repository  
![](gh-repo-creation.png)
3. Copy the repository URL  
![](repo-url.png)
    - Make sure you select SSH instead of HTTPS
4. Open RStudio
5. Go to File -> New Project
6. Select Version Control  
![](new-project.png)
7. Choose git
8. Paste the repository URL in  
![](new-project-clone.png)
    - You can adjust the name of the directory that is created by changing 
    Project directory name
    - Make sure you pay attention to where the project is created. This is where
    your repository/directory/project will live
9. Click Create Project
